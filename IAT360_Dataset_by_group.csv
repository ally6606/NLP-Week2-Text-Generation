W6S482dRQ_9nCcLjfv8VNg,2,"I have been to this location a number of times over the years. Bit I haven’t eaten here in about 18 months because of the service. Based on my experience this time 10/1/25. I would not recommend. I arrived 12:45. 2-3 customers already eating and 2 people waiting for there to go orders. A small group of 4 people in front of me. So maybe busy for this place. But not what I would call crazy busy. I placed my order Butter chicken and paid. Had a seat next to a guy and he said to me I hope you’re not in a rush that he’s been waiting 35 minutes about 10 minutes later his food was ready. I waited 45 minutes and asked for my money back. I was told no that my food was ready. Another 5 minutes and he brings my food. The butter chicken was way too salty not edible. I took 2-3 bites and asked again for a refund and was told they couldn’t give me a refund That they would remake my food. But after spending over an hour waiting for my food, I decided it wasn’t worth the time and threw my food in the trash instead.

W6S482dRQ_9nCcLjfv8VNg,1,"I'm very disappointed with the food I received from this hotel. The chicken served was clearly old and close to spoiling — it had a bad smell and poor texture, indicating it was either spoiled or cooked long ago and kept for too long. This is absolutely unacceptable. We work hard to earn our money, and once in a while, we treat ourselves by ordering from places we expect to serve quality food. It's really disheartening to receive such poor-quality food when all we want is a decent meal. Please take this feedback seriously. Do not serve spoiled or leftover chicken again. We expect fresh, hygienic food when we pay for it. I hope this doesn’t happen again.",0,0,0,Bawarchi Indian Restaurant,2910 Concord Pike,Wilmington,DE,2,3.5,"Indian, Chinese, Restaurants"

However I had a very unpleasant experience with the staff here. Around 15 minutes before closing they had multiple staff come up to me around 4 times in the span of 2 minutes telling me the place is closing soon (and one particular staff was around 3 of those times.) Then around 5-10 minutes before closing while I was still packing up that staff started yelling at me and said things he probably shouldn’t say to customers like “there’s always that one customer”. It really ruined my mood and it was quite inappropriate given that I wasn’t like trying to stick around after closing and still had a few minutes to pack up.

We ordered the Filet Edmund which was supposed to be filet mignonettes with crab meat and bearnaise sauce, and the Delmonico. The salads that came with the meals were mediocre. The tomatoes on my tomato and mozzarella salad were grocery-store tomatoes and not very good ones. The Caesar salad was just a plate of romaine. I expected the mignonettes to be 2 small filets, not chunks of filet, so they were overcooked and the bearnaise was just gravy. The crabmeat on the Filet Edmund was fantastic but not with gravy.

citzbW-2MVEZRNBqpVO-Jw,2,"Had a solid experience at Buffalo Wild Wings during happy hour! The hot buffalo wings were exactly what I was craving - good heat level with that classic tangy buffalo flavor, and the wings were cooked perfectly with crispy skin. Not the spiciest I’ve had, but definitely packed enough punch to satisfy.
The garden salad was a nice refreshing balance to the wings. Fresh greens, decent portion size, and the vegetables were crisp. Nothing fancy, but it did its job as a lighter side to cut through all that buffalo sauce.
The real winner was the happy hour strawberry margarita - fruity, well-balanced, and a great deal during happy hour pricing. Definitely helped cool down the heat from the wings and made the whole meal more enjoyable.
Service was friendly and the atmosphere was typical BWW - sports on every screen and a lively crowd.

-Nice ambiance with TV entertainment.
-Comfortable seating.
-Poor customer service. Waiter not very friendly. It’s as if they were hiding behind the mask.
-Price $18.95 per person whether adult or child before 3pm. It’s truly an all you can eat, don’t order more than you can eat or you pay additional for take out.

Overall, nice restaurant if you love sushi/rolls.",0,0,0,Sakura Japanese Restaurant,4713 Kirkwood Hwy,Wilmington,DE,2,4,"Japanese, Restaurants, Sushi Bars, Noodles"
